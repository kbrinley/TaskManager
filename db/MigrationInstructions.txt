First, remove all double quotes (") from dump file
Remove first line of file (starts with Parma)
Remove all lines regarding CREATE TABLE (migration does this)
Remove all lines regarding indexes (migration does this too)
Remove all lines creating Goal Types (and this)
For Users, change Admin/Premium flag from T/F to 1/0 (yes, 1 = T, 0 = F)
